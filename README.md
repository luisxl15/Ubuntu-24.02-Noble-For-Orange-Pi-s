# Ubuntu-24.02-Noble-For-Orange-Pis
By searching and not finding any unmodified Ubuntu images (like the one provided by Orange Pi that has several modifications), I decided to build one from scratch. Currently, I have only created it for the Orange Pi 3B, but if there aren't any for other Orange Pi models, you can request one, and I will try to build one for the specific model you have. Feel free to reach out if you're interested.
